== Description ==

Fluxor is a simple starter theme to create fast and minimal web site. You can customize fonts and colors.

Fluxor has Blog Layout, Category, Tag & Search Layout and a animated mobile menu. 

Fluxor has a social icon system for the quick menu, once you have created a set of custom links in the menu just add a class from this list (.icon-dribbble, .icon-linkedin, .icon-instagram, .icon-facebook, .icon-github, .icon-tiktok, .icon-youtube).

Fluxor has a content search system within the site that opens in a popup, to activate it just add a custom link in the menus and associate the css class (.icon-search), the default icon is black, to invert the color just add an additional css class (.icon-invert).

Fluxor has Two menu on the top (main and quick) with icons and One menu on the footer.

Fluxor has 3 page templates (Default Template, Home Template, Landing Template), the landing template sets a page without menu and without footer so you can fully customize it for a landing page.

To creare a One page Scroll Structure add to the menu www.yoursite.com/#section-1 and the class .page-scroll to the menu element (the system will scroll with animation)

To create an animated anchor to any element marked with an (id="element") just add the class (.scroll) to the link (href="#element")
